# 8.2 Binary Tree

A **binary tree** is an **ordered** tree with the following properties:

1. Every node has **at most** two children.
2. Each child node is labeled as being either a **left** child or a **right** child.、
3. A left child **precedes** a right child in the order of children of a node.

**Left subtree / right subtree**, the subtree rooted at a left or right child of an internal node v.

A binary tree is **proper** if each node has either zero or two children.

###  Recursive Binary Tree Definition

Define a binary tree in a recursive way.

* An empty tree.
* A nonempty tree having a root node r, which stores an element, and two binary trees that are respectively the left and right subtrees of r.
