# 7.3 Positional Lists

Numeric indices are not  good choice for describing positions within a **linked list** because, knowing only an elementâ€™s index, the only way to reach it is to traverse the list incrementally from its beginning or end.

Our goal is to design an abstract data type that provides a user a way to refer to elements anywhere in a sequence, and to perform arbitrary insertions and deletions.
