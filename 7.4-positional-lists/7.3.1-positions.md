# 7.3.1 Positions

The index-based methods of Javaâ€™s formal List interface, and instead develop our own abstract data type that we denote as a **positional list.**

`getElement()`: Returns the element stored at this position.

A **position** acts as a marker or token within a broader positional list. 

A position p, which is associated with some element e in a list L, does not change, even if the index of e changes in L due to insertions or deletions elsewhere in the list. Nor does position p change if we replace the element e stored at p with another element. The only way in which a position becomes invalid is if that position \(and its element\) are explicitly removed from the list.

### JAVA Interface Definitions

```java
pubic interface Position<E> {
  /**
  *Returns the element stored at this position
  *
  *@return the stored element
  *@throws IllegalStateException if position no longer valid
  */
  E getElement() throws IllegalStateException;
}
```
