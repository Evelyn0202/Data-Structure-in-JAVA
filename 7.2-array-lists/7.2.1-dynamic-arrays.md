# 7.2.1 Dynamic Arrays

Java’s ArrayList class provides an abstraction, allowing a user to add elements to the list, with no apparent limit on the overall capacity. Java relies on an algorithmic sleight of hand that is known as a **dynamic array**.

The first key to providing the semantics of an unbounded array is that an array list instance maintains an internal array that often has greater capacity than the current length of the list.

If a user continues to add elements to a list, all reserved capacity in the underly- ing array will eventually be exhausted.

Copies all references from the smaller array into the beginning of the new array.
