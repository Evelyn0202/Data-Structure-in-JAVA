# 8.1.1 Tree Definitions and Properties

A **tree** is an abstract data type that stores elements hierarchically.

With the exception of the top element, each element in a tree has a **parent** element and zero or more **children** elements.

### Formal Tree Definition

A **tree T** as a set of nodes storing elements such that the **nodes** have a **parent-child** relationship that satisfies the following properties:

* If **T** is nonempty, it has a special node, called the **root** of T , that has no parent. 
* Each **node v** of **T** different from the root has a **unique parent** **node w**; every

  node with parent w is a **child** of w.

### Other Node Relationships

* **siblings :** Two nodes that are children of the same parent.
* **external :** if node v has no children. \(Also known as **leaves**\)
* **internal :** if node v has one or more children.
